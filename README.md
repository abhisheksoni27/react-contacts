## react-contacts

A Simple Contacts App Implementation in ReactJS.  

Wanna first see how it looks? &#8594; [Demo](https://codeprose.me/react-contacts) :tada:

## How to make it work at home

1. Clone the repository (yes, that big green button at the top.) and navigate to the folder.

2. **In a Terminal**

```bash
$ sudo yarn start
```

This will start the project in `development` mode.

3. If you want to deploy it to GitHub Pages because you have made some flabbargasting changes and now can't wait to share it with the world, go to your terminal and run

```bash
$ sudo yarn build
```

This will generate the build folder which can be deployed to any static hosting provider. (**_Hint:_** GitHub, Bro! Don't tell anyone.)

4. Copy the **build** folder's contents and _boom-shaw-shey-upload_. :tada:
